# Linear Regression based on Gradient Descent
This repository provides a sample MATLAB code in order to perform a supervised Machine Learning algorithm: Gradient Descent based on gradient descent. 

The main MATLAB file is named "LinearRegressionGrdDsc.m" while the other MATLAB files are fuctions used in the main file. Furthermore, three sets of input data are included.
